# Swing-BinaryConversion

This is just a small little app to learn some basics of Swing.

Time and ambition permitting, switching from Longs to BigIntegers is a goal, so that there will be no limitations with number size.

(This branch will likely not change from this point unless
I add something that should be common to all versions).
