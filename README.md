# Swing-BinaryConversion

This is just a small little app to learn some basics of Swing.

Finally switched to BigIntegers. No more size limitations (well, within reason).
Just for fun I used to app to calculate a 26,649 digit binary number.
It took a few seconds, but it's nice to know this app allows such things.
