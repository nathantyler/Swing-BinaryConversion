This is just a small little app to learn the very basics
of Swing.

I just needed some small thing to learn about action listeners
so I settled on binary conversion that I had already written as an
exercise sometime before.

Eventually I want to convert the longs to BigIntegers so the size of the number
is never really an issue. That's the next version.
